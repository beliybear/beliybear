Hey there 👋

I'm Ian. 
iOS developer focused on production-quality applications, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I work primarily with UIKit and modern iOS APIs, building and supporting apps used by real users under real constraints. I have hands-on experience with large production applications published on the App Store, including full release cycles, post-release support, and production bug fixing.

My background includes refactoring legacy architectures and navigation, improving performance and memory usage through profiling, and developing complex user flows such as media feeds, chats, and location-based features. I’ve worked extensively with Apollo GraphQL, REST APIs, CoreData caching, deep links, and dependency injection using Swinject.

I care deeply about predictability and clarity in code. Most of my work revolves around reducing unnecessary complexity, making UI behavior explicit, and ensuring that systems remain understandable and maintainable as products grow — especially in long-living codebases.

Alongside product work, I maintain several lightweight open-source Swift libraries extracted from production code. They are designed with simplicity, zero external dependencies, and modern Swift concurrency in mind, and reflect the same engineering principles I apply in commercial projects.

I enjoy collaborating closely with backend, QA, and product teams, participating in code reviews, and improving engineering standards — not just shipping features, but owning their behavior in production.
